Site Admin Creator is the highest level role. Before receiving this role I wasn't able to see other users for a Tableau Cloud. Now I can. So the best assumption is my role was Creator

🧩 When to Choose Each:
Use Case	Best Option
You want full control over security, data, and server configurations	Tableau Server
You have strict internal compliance or data residency requirements	Tableau Server
You prefer a fully managed, maintenance-free solution	Tableau Cloud
Your users are remote or geographically distributed	Tableau Cloud
You want to quickly deploy and scale without IT involvement	Tableau Cloud

🔁 Migration Note:
Many organizations are moving from Tableau Server to Tableau Cloud to reduce infrastructure complexity, but some retain Tableau Server for compliance or integration flexibility.
